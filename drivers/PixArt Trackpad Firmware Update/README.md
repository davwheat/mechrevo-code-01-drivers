# WARNING

**Make sure that your device uses the PixArt trackpad!**

Eluktronics use a different glass trackpad, and some other manufacturers may use different ones too.

TongFang (the OEM) may also change the trackpad they use, too!

If you install this firmware update and your device does not use a PixArt trackpad, you could brick your laptop entirely. Please be careful!

## Install instructions

1. Run `install.bat` **as an administrator** (otherwise you will get "Error 5")
2. Wait for it to complete
3. You're done!

**Note:** Your trackpad may deactivate for a minute after the update. Mine took about 15 seconds to reactivate. During this time, the trackpad lock light was switched on.
