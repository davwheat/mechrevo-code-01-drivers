Q. Why has "WOL & Shutdown Link Speed" option ?

A. Realtek change "WOL & Shutdown Link Speed" to "10Mbps first" for better power saving.

   Realtek add this option because some special usage case.

   For example, using non store-and-forward switch and a lot of port connect to a computer.

   If incoming packet is broadcast or multicast, the packet will use the IFG which is the lowest among connected ports.

   It will dynamically slow down the transfer speed if you use multicast packets or broadcast packet to transfer a image.

   For such case, you could change to "100Mbps first" to has better transfer speed.
